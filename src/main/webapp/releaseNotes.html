							<h2>Version 3.10 - Production</h2>
							<h3>Version 3.10.11 - Release November 19, 2014</h3>
							<p>Production ready version. The following changes were made:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Diphtheria: Fixed issue where if first dose given after
									7 years of age was a Td and a Tdap on the same date the
									transition did not work properly.</li>
								<li>Fixed forecasting issue where concurrent requests to
									the forecaster can cause one of the requests to fail. This was
									found to happen when sending a volley of 100,000 messages in 10
									threads at the forecaster (a level not expected to be done in
									any of the current production systems.) It was determined that
									if two requests were processed at the exact same time that one
									of them could fail. The problem is now fixed and the forecaster
									can process a continuous stream of requests from up to 10
									sources without problems and without slowing down.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.10 - Release October 10, 2014</h3>
							<p>Production ready version. The following changes were made:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Influenza: Fixed issue where H1N1 given was being seen
									as a regular flu season dose. Caused logic for determining
									second dose to not work properly.</li>
								<li>Diphtheria: Fixed issue with missing grace period for a
									single transition (K5).</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.9 - Release October 3, 2014</h3>
							<p>This version is ready for production use. Includes minor
								fixes identified during user acceptance testing.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Diphtheria: Fixed transition in childhood schedule when
									child becomes late, so that it transitions appropriately under
									specific circumstances from the 3rd dose to the 4 year old
									catchup dose.</li>
								<li>HPV: Fixed due date for second dose for males to match
									females for dose two.</li>
								<li>Influenza: Fixed issue with not recognizing H1N1
									vaccine in flu rules and added CVX code to list of vaccines.</li>
								<li>MMR & Varicella: Changed MMRV administration so that if
									given after 13 it is still counted as valid. (MMRV should not
									be given after 13 but can be counted as valid if done.)</li>
								<li>Polio: Fixed transition from 3rd dose for children
									under 4 year old to move to P4 instead of catchup booster. Not
									a major change except it keeps the patient from being shown as
									overdue for fourth dose.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.8 - Release September 19, 2014</h3>
							<p>This version is ready for production use. One minor fix
								from previous release.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Fixed logic for * dose counts. Previously it was
									reporting dose 0 or 1, when it should have been reporting 1 or
									0. This only affected certain catchup doses that requiring
									counting to set dose number.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.7 - Release September 18, 2014</h3>
							<p>This version is intended for production use. Very minor
								changes from previous version.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Diptheria: Changed transition for alternative primary
									schedule for children to go to K4 if 3rd dose is given after 4
									years of age. Updated K4 valid and overdue dates to more
									expected values.</li>
								<li>Hib: Set alternative catchup dose to have a variable
									dose number depending on how many valid doses given before.</li>
								<li>Pneumo: Set alternative catchup dose to have variable
									dose number and updated valid, due and overdue dates on catchup
									schedule to more appropriate values.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.6 - Release September 17, 2014</h3>
							<p>This version is intended for production use. Very minor
								changes from previous version.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Hib: Minor fix to schedule for a catchup schedule.</li>
								<li>Polio: Minor fix to schedule for a catchup schedule.</li>
								<li>IHS Interface: Added support for reporting back CVX
									codes of parts of message that are invalid.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.5 - Release September 16, 2014</h3>
							<p>This version should be ready for production use. A few
								minor changes were made, but testing is nearly complete.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Diptheria: Changed age transitions to happen 4 days
									before the actual age, so a Tdap given at 7 years - 4 days is
									considered valid for adult schedule.</li>
								<li>Hib: Changed age transitions to include 4 day grace
									period.</li>
								<li>Pneumo: Changed age transitions to include 4 day grace
									period.</li>
								<li>Polio: Changed age transition to include 4 day grace
									period, fixed issue with transition not happening when 2nd dose
									given after 4 years of age.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.4 - Release September 8, 2014</h3>
							<p>This is a testing release, and may be ready for production
								use. It must be tested first.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Diphtheria: Modified Tdap so that it counts if DTaP or
									DTP is given.</li>
								<li>Influenza: Added support for new CVX 161 code.</li>
								<li>Hib: Added new Catchup Booster dose to correctly mark
									vaccination as overdue immediately.</li>
								<li>Polio: Added new Catchup Booster dose to correctly mark
									vaccination as overdue immediately.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.3 - Release August 29, 2014</h3>
							<p>This is a testing release, and will likely not be released
								for production use. Please note that many of the fixes listed
								below are not known to be problems in the current production
								release. Rather they are fixes to problems introduced in the
								previous patch.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Pnuemo: Added a state C4 for dealing with a first and
									final dose differently than a final dose after other
									vaccinations.</li>
								<li>Hib: Added back in some transitions for doses given
									instead of by age. This allows the dates to stay the same until
									a dose is given. This is a good balance between age transition
									and dose transition on certain ages.</li>
								<li>Polio: Fixed 4 year old transition on P3. A typo caused
									it not to work.</li>
								<li>Influenza: Fixed issue with H1N1, should have been
									fixed before but forgot to copy over XML in last release.</li>
								<li>Diptheria: Another state was added to manage when the
									4th dose is not given on time. Fixed logic for determining if
									Tdap had been given previously. This was not working in the
									previous patch so it was impossible to transition to the final
									10 year booster.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.2 - Release August 27, 2014</h3>
							<p>This is a testing release, and will likely not be released
								for production use. Please note that many of the fixes listed
								below are not known to be problems in the current production
								release. Rather they are fixes to problems introduced in the
								previous patch.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Hib: Reworked the Hib Diagram based on feedback from
									Brady during testing.</li>
								<li>Diphtheria: Found a problem with transitions on age if
									a vaccination give on the day of transition. Fixed bug by
									giving priority to transition.</li>
								<li>Diphtheria: Fixed issue with not properly transitioning
									to booster dose when tdap is given.</li>
								<li>Diphtheria: Tdap given as a booster (K5 and P4) will
									count as a valid transition for children under 7. P1, P2, P3,
									P1a, P2a, P3a will still count as invalid.</li>
								<li>Influenza: Change to influenza moved the valid date to
									the first date when the flu shot could be given regardless of
									the season. This was different than the previous version that
									moved the valid date to the start of the season. Now the valid
									date will be adjusted to start of season if before the season.
									This should reduce differences between this version and
									previous versions.</li>
								<li>Influenza: Contraindication of the Live Flu was
									affecting the due date of the standard recommendation. That has
									been fixed.</li>
								<li>Influenza: Added H1N1 codes to the standard list of flu
									codes, otherwise logic did not work correctly.</li>
								<li>Influenza: The tester was showing "unknown" status for
									a vaccination series that was complete. This was because the
									flu now does not report the next dates due, and should have
									been moved to a different section of the report. That has been
									done so now the tester should show the status correctly.</li>
								<li>Influenza: Fixed issue with seasonal overdue date not
									set correctly.</li>
								<li>Polio: Fixed minor issue on transition so it worked
									properly. (4 Years Old was valued as '7 months' and so did not
									work properly.)</li>
								<li>PCV: Removed extra state that was added in the previous
									version.</li>
								<li>PCV: Added new state to handle when the 3rd dose has
									not yet been given and should be immediately given.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.10.1 - Release August 20, 2014</h3>
							<p>This is a testing release, and will not be released for
								production use. Five forecast antigens have been completely
								rewritten:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Diptheria: Completely new transitions from DTaP to
									Tdap.</li>
								<li>Hib: New diagram and transitions.</li>
								<li>Influenza: Major change to how forecasting is done.
									Completely new diagram and logic for driving second dose
									decision. Incorporates 2014 ACIP rules.</li>
								<li>Pneumo: New diagram and transitions, support for PCV-13
									supplemental dose after a PCV-7 series has been removed.</li>
								<li>Polio: New diagram and transitions.</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Changes specific to Influenza:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Valid date for influenza is now always 6 months after
									the birth of the patient and will never reflect start of
									season.</li>
								<li>The previous seasons are now all lumped together as
									simply previous doses that do not count towards completion.
									Minimum 4 week intervals and live virus conflicts are still
									checked, but not determination is made about compliance with 2
									dose requirements in the seasons before the current one.</li>
								<li>The transition diagram has bee simplified by the
									introduction of a new concept of Decision Logic that is written
									custom to determine transition from the first seasonal dose to
									possibly a second season dose. This simplifies and standardizes
									the flu schedule. However, when ACIP changes their schedule,
									the Decision Logic piece will have to be rewritten. This will
									require a new release of the flu forecast.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Version 3.9</h2>
							<h3>Version 3.9.4 - Released June 17, 2014</h3>
							<p>Final set of improvements for Spring 2014 release</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Version was incremented because of a major fix to the
									logic for determining the valid intervals between invalid and
									valid administration of vaccinations. The TCH Forecaster now
									applies the invalid interval only to the previously given
									invalid dose and the valid interval to the previously given
									valid dose. This change aligns with the intention of the means
									of the valid and invalid interval values. While this change is
									fairly big from the sense of logic it's impact is only minor as
									most invalid and valid intervals are the same. Only in a few
									scenarios was this problem evident.</li>
								<li>HPV: Male schedule was not setup exactly the same as
									female schedule. Apparently improvements made previously to
									female schedule were not applied to male. Male schedule is now
									aligned with female.</li>
								<li>Hep A: Increased grace period between invalid
									administration of 2nd dose and next valid administration of 2nd
									dose. The forecaster will not recommend a 6 month gap but will
									accept the 2nd dose as soon as it can be given after the 1st
									dose.</li>
								<li>Varicella: Removed requirement that 2nd dose be given
									at 15 months (with a grace period of 8 weeks). Now only the
									minimum interval of 12 weeks (with a grace period of 8 weeks)
									is enforced.</li>
								<li>For IHS version fixed issue with Hep A child/parent
									doses not being properly coded for the forecaster.</li>
								<li>For IHS version added filter so that specific
									vaccinations doses would be forecasted on the valid date and
									others on the early date when the IHS user requested an
									accelerated schedule. <a
									href="https://code.google.com/p/tch-forecaster/issues/detail?id=59">Issue
										59</a>
								</li>
								<li>Diphtheria: Added a 6 week early due for all first
									doses. This only affects those who select to use the early due
									date.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Version 3.8</h2>
							<h3>Version 3.8.4 - Released April 24, 2014</h3>
							<p>Improvements for IHS deployment and TCH deployment.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Fixed issue with Influenza IIV being improperly
									contraindicated when given after Varicella.</li>
								<li>Moved report version to top of report for IHS.</li>
								<li>Fixed issue with Influenza forecast not working
									properly when given immediately at the start of the season on
									July 1st.</li>
								<li>Made minor changes to the Java API, for integration
									into TCH system.</li>
								<li>Added setting the influenza season in the IHS
									forecaster.</li>
								<li>Added filter for Influenza so IHS is not forecasted for
									flu after 04/01 of every season.</li>
								<li>Added contraindications for Flu LAIV4 that were only
									working before for Flu LAIV3.</li>
								<li>Added temporary fix to IHS version to not report back
									invalid Hep B for Pediarix when given between 2nd and 3rd dose.</li>
								<li>Fixed issue displaying text for invalid reason on
									detailed forecast report.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Version 3.7</h2>
							<h3>Version 3.7.1 - Released April 2, 2014</h3>
							<p>Improvements for IHS deployment.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Added new field to Forecast Options - Recommend When
									Valid. If set to true, the forecaster will indicate
									vaccinations that are due today because the valid due date has
									now been satisified. Normally this does not ocurr until the due
									date is reached. This option may be used to forecast as soon as
									possible for patients.</li>
								<li>Mening will now not forecast for 19+ years of age.
									Considered to be finished by that age.</li>
								<li>Fixed minor spelling issue.</li>
								<li>Fixed interface issue for IHS to indicate to valid or
									invalid vaccinations.</li>
								<li>Change report format for IHS so that lines are
									deliminated by special characters.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.5.12 - Released March 28, 2014</h3>
							<p>Improvements found after testing with IHS and TCH test
								cases:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The early due and early overdue functionality were
									further improved. Previously the forecaster reported out these
									data separately and let the report writer or receiver of the
									data to decide which to show. Now the forecaster will only
									report due and overdue dates, but can use the alternative early
									dates if the Forecast Options indicate that this should be
									done. This change had to be made as the forecaster has a fair
									amount of logic around due and overdue dates that gets very
									complicated if both of these dates and their early twins must
									be considered. Now the logic sets the dates correctly early on
									and the rest of the logic flows normally from there.</li>
								<li>Change overdue date for second MCV4 from 19 years to 17
									years.</li>
								<li>Fixed issue with influenza season setting function was
									not resetting properly to default. Caused a problem only for
									testing.</li>
								<li>Fixed issue with Hib forecast finishing too soon rather
									than completing evaluation of series. Did not affect final
									result recommendation.</li>
								<li>Fixed issue with Java API interface not returning
									results properly.</li>
								<li>Fixed issue with MCV4 not showing up in IHS (was
									showing on report but was not transmitting to IHS in proper
									format).</li>
								<li>Fixed issue with DTaP not showing early overdue date
									for IHS. Forecaster was working properly but IHS connector was
									not properly indicating need to send back early date.</li>
								<li>Fixed issue with influenza contraindication now
									engaging at the correct time. Results were accurate but appears
									of contraindication was unnecessary and confusing.</li>
								<li>Compact report for IHS now does not include irrelevant
									forecasts. The supporting text below however gives all details.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Version 3.4</h2>
							<h3>Version 3.4.1</h3>
							<p>Changes for Indian Health Service and Texas Children's
								Hospital:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Added support for assumptions for adults who are
									assumed to have received childhood series. The forecaster will
									not automatically assume an adult record has received childhood
									immunizations. Rather, these must be asserted at the time of
									the request.</li>
								<li>Added ability to ignore vaccinations that are sub
									potent. This is a preliminary ability and needs to be further
									tested before being used in production.</li>
								<li>Added ability to force a vaccination to be valid even
									if given too soon. This is a preliminary ability and needs to
									be further tested.</li>
								<li>Changed MMR and Varicella interaction so that they have
									a 28 day separation instead of a 24 days.</li>
								<li>Added support for MenHibrix in Hib schedule.</li>
								<li>Fixed two minor issues with IHS interface.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Version 3.3</h2>
							<h3>Version 3.3.1</h3>
							<p>Changes to the detailed information associated with each
								vaccine type forecaster for and changes to the IHS interface.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Added invalid code and invalid reason to the IHS
									defined interface.</li>
								<li>Changed how the detailed logging is done so it can be
									displayed either in HTML or plain text. This change was needed
									to support IHS need to display details in text format. This
									change resulted in a major change to the interface for
									reporting back details. Previously there was a traceBuffer
									available that included details on entire forecast process, but
									this was redundant with the details in each trace log. So the
									traceBuffer has been removed.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Version 3.2</h2>
							<h3>Version 3.2.6</h3>
							<p>This latest release has the following major improvements:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Updated support for CDC CVX codes. Previous versions
									did not properly support all codes.</li>
								<li>Integrated ability to report on exactly how codes are
									supported. This insures accurate documentation of functionality
									of forecaster.</li>
								<li>Reporting on status of all vaccine types forecasted
									for. Previously if a patient was finished or complete for a
									vaccine series no recommendations or forecasts were given. The
									recipient was required to assume that the patient did not need
									these vaccinations. Now the interface reports back statuses on
									all vaccinations, even if they are no longer relevant.</li>
								<li>The Influenza forecast can now split if a
									contraindicated live vaccine is given within 28 days of a
									recommended for Influenza. If this happens the forecaster will
									report a recommendation for Influenza IIV to be given on time
									and a contraindicated forecast for Influenza LAIV to be given
									at a later date. The new status field on the result indicates
									that a dose is currently contraindicated and the dates indicate
									when the vaccination should be given.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>It is important for API users to understand the need to
								filter results before displaying to the end user. The forecaster
								now returns a great deal more information some of which may not
								be relevant. For example, all patients, regardless of age, will
								receive a Rotavirus forecast. For most patients this forecast
								will simply indicate the patient is finished or complete. These
								type of results would not normally be shown to clinicians giving
								regular care. Please consult the API documentation to understand
								how to properly interpret the results.</p>
