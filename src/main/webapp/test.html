							<p>The TCH Forecast Tester provides easy access to the TCH
								Forecaster and other forecasters to support testing and
								verification. All Immunization and CDS experts are invited to
								join the TCH Forecast Tester project.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>To register or re-accept the user agreement please
									visit the <a href="http://tchforecasttester.org/ft/HomePage">TCH
										Forecast Tester (old interface)</a>
								</li>
								<li>To view test cases and test results: <a

										Tester (new interface)</a>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Release Notes</h2>
							<h3>Version 3.08</h3>
							<p>The latest release include changes to the new TCH Forecast
								Tester interface. The old interface has been nearly completely
								replaced by the new interface.</p>
							<h2>Release Notes</h2>
							<h3>Version 3.03</h3>
							<p>Highlights of latest release:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Added support for indicating to the TCH Forecaster to
									assume patient is up-to-date on a range of childhood
									vaccinations that are not given to adults who received them as
									children.</li>
								<li>Added new admin category of Assume complete or immune.
									This matches new functionality in the TCH Forecaster to assume
									patient is up-to-date and communicate that assumption back to
									the forecast consumer.</li>
								<li>Added support for indicating that a vaccination was sub
									potent or should be forced as valid. Currently these too
									functions are only supported by the TCH forecaster. Support on
									other forecasters will need to be evaluated for future
									versions.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Version 3.01</h3>
							<p>Highlights of latest release:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Underlying database has been enlarged to support
									expanded testing. Some of these changes are currently visible
									now but most will not be enabled until later this year. These
									changes will be needed to support the CDSi project for 2014.</li>
								<li>Changed how complete is documented. Previously an
									expectation or actual result with a dose number of COMP was
									considered complete. This was an overloading of the meaning of
									dose number. A new field has been added to indicate Status.</li>
								<li>Matching rules have been updated to require that status
									also be matched. Users should now set expected status, along
									with dose number, valid, due and overdue dates.</li>
							</ul>
