  </p>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <h3>Download lsvfweb.war</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Right click on the "Download the TCH Forecaster" link and select "Save target as..." or "Save link as..."</li>
    <li>This should open the file save as dialog box on Internet Explorer or Firefox and allow you to save the application file to your local
      computer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> Internet Explorer has difficulty saving the fweb.war file properly. Please ensure you save save it exactly as fweb.war and not as
    fweb.war.txt or fweb.txt. Also please ensure that the file type from txt to all programs.
  </p>
  <h3>Save fweb.war</h3>
  <p>The TCH Forecaster application is called "fweb.war" and must be installed into Tomcat in order to operate on your local system.
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Save or copy the downloaded file to the Tomcat/webapps directory.</li>
    <li>On Windows system this is typically here: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\webapps</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Confirmation</h3>
  <p>If you have followed the previous steps correctly you will see that Tomcat automatically creates a folder named "fweb" inside the webapps
    folder. The happened because fweb.war is actually a zip file that Tomcat recognizes. When you saved the fweb.war file in the webapps folder,
    Tomcat recognized it and expanded it into a folder.</p>
  <p>Once Tomcat has expanded the webapps folder it will download a 140kb sized file named tchforecaster.jar and save it in Tomcat's /bin folder
    or in Tomcat's root folder. This file is the TCH Forecaster logic and is updated each time Tomcat is started.</p>

  <h2>Instructions for Test</h2>
  <p>The instructions above give directions on how to install the Forecaster for production. Before a new version of the TCH Forecaster is
    released for production it is released for test. The installation above can be configured to request the test version instead of the production
    version. Often this will be the same version, but if a new test version has been released, this configuration change will ensure the latest
    version out on test is being used.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Following standard installation process.</li>
    <li>Stop Tomcat if it is running.</li>
    <li>Open he web.xml file in a text editor (such as Windows Wordpad). This file will be found in the [Tomcat Folder]/webapps/fweb/WEB-INF
      folder.</li>
    <li>Find the line that reads <code>&lt;param-value&gt;http://tchforecasttester.org/tch-forecaster.jar&lt;/param-value&gt;</code> and change
      to <code>&lt;param-value&gt;http://tchforecasttester.org/tch-forecaster<b>-test</b>.jar&lt;/param-value&gt;</code> by simply adding the text <code>-test</code>
      to the URL.
    </li>
    <li>Start Tomcat</li>
  </ul>
